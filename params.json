{"name":"Thesis: Space-Time ARIMA","tagline":"","body":"### Abstract\r\nThe purpose of the study is to expose the three iterative model building procedure of space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (STARIMA) on both simulated and actual (rainfall) data. This paper uses the Box and Jenkins back-forecasting technique for estimating the observations at time nt < 1. The method used for parameter estimation is based on nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which minimizes the conditional and unconditional sum of squares functions of the simulated and rainfall data, respectively. The statistical software used is R, and methods of space-time ARIMA in R is presented in this paper. Finally, the space-time ARIMA forecast errors were found to be satisfactory for both data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
