## Thesis: Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

### Abstract
The purpose of the study is to expose the three iterative model building
procedure of space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (STARIMA)
on both simulated and actual (rainfall) data. This paper uses the Box and
Jenkins back-forecasting technique for estimating the observations at time
t < 1. The method used for parameter estimation is based on nonlinear
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which minimizes the conditional and uncon-
ditional sum of squares functions of the simulated and rainfall data, respec-
tively. The statistical software used is R, and methods of space-time ARIMA
in R is presented in this paper. Finally, the space-time ARIMA forecast errors
were found to be satisfactory for both data.

## Scope of the Study
This study will focus on ARIMA and STARIMA modelling, and will
cover the identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking. The study will
use the R statistical package for graphical illustrations and numeric computa-
tions. The data analysed is the rainfall data of the city of Hong Kong.
